However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community\n   chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\n   In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the\n   player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive\n   doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they\n   proceed directly to jail.\n   At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a\n   player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective\n   pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom\n   of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of\n   this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any\n   instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player\n   will remain on the CC/CH square.\n     •\_Community Chest (2/16 cards):\n        \_1.\_Advance to GO\n        \_2.\_Go to JAIL\n     •\_Chance (10/16 cards):\n        \_1.\_Advance to GO\n        \_2.\_Go to JAIL\n        \_3.\_Go to C1\n        \_4.\_Go to E3\n        \_5.\_Go to H2\n        \_6.\_Go to R1\n        \_7.\_Go to next R (railway company)\n        \_8.\_Go to next R\n        \_9.\_Go to next U (utility company)\n        10.\_Go back 3 squares.\n   The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular\n   square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.\n   For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for\n   which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have\n   the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and\n   it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we\n   are interested in. We shall make no distinction between \"Just Visiting\"\n   and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring\n   a double to \"get out of jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their\n   next turn.\n   By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we\n   can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond\n   with sets of squares.\n   Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in\n   order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO\n   (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed\n   with the six-digit modal string: 102400.\n   If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the\n   six-digit modal string."

    description: "   In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which\n   is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.\n   The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the\n   dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores\n   zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single\n   scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and\n   treble scores respectively.\n   At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull\n   region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull\n   is a double, worth 50 points.\n   There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the\n   players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce\n   their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a\n   \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double\n   (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final\n   dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one\n   or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".\n   When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a\n   \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s\n   and double bull).\n   There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:\n                                   ┌──┬──┬──┐\n                                   │D3│\_ │\_ │\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │D1│D2│\_ │\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S2│D2│\_ │\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │D2│D1│\_ │\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S4│D1│\_ │\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S1│S1│D2│\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S1│T1│D1│\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S1│S3│D1│\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │D1│D1│D1│\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │D1│S2│D1│\n                                   ├──┼──┼──┤\n                                   │S2│S2│D1│\n                                   └──┴──┴──┘\n   Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on\n   different doubles.

If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint\n   of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.\n   We will call a common point T of two segments L[1] and L[2] a true\n   intersection point of L[1] and L[2] if T is the only common point of L[1]\n   and L[2] and T is an interior point of both segments.\n   Consider the three segments L[1], L[2], and L[3]:\n   L[1]: (27, 44) to (12, 32)\n   L[2]: (46, 53) to (17, 62)\n   L[3]: (46, 70) to (22, 40)\n   It can be verified that line segments L[2] and L[3] have a true\n   intersection point.

So among the three line\n   segments, we find one true intersection point.\n   Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate\n   20000 numbers using the so-called \"Blum Blum Shub\" pseudo-random number\n   generator.\n   s[0] = 290797\n   s[n+1] = s[n]×s[n] (modulo 50515093)\n   t[n] = s[n] (modulo 500)\n   To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers t[n].

The wall must be a closed series of straight\n   lines, each line running from post to post.\n   The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the\n   entire 250 000 m^2 area.

    description: "   Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital\n   root\" clocks.\n   A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step\n   by step.\n   When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the\n   calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the\n   result.\n   For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \"137\" →\n   \"11\" → \"2\" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.\n   Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal\n   (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left,\n   bottom-right).\n   Number \"1\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \"4\" is\n   made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and\n   bottom-right. Number \"8\" lights them all.\n   The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.\n   To turn on a \"2\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"7\" will cost only 4\n   transitions.\n   Sam and Max built two different clocks.\n   Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"137\", then the panel\n   is turned off, then the next number (\"11\") is turned on, then the panel is\n   turned off again and finally the last number (\"2\") is turned on and, after\n   some time, off.\n   For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\n   \"137\" : (2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions (\"137\" on/off).\n   \"11\"  : (2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions (\"11\" on/off).\n   \"2\"   : (5) × 2 = 10 transitions (\"2\" on/off).\n   For a grand total of 40 transitions.\n   Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it\n   is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for\n   the next number.\n   For number 137, Max's clock requires:\n           2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"137\" on)\n   \"137\" : 7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for\n           number \"11\").\n           0 transitions (number \"11\" is already turned on correctly)\n   \"11\"  : 3 transitions (to turn off the first \"1\" and the bottom part of\n           the second \"1\";\n           the top part is common with number \"2\").\n           4 tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a\n   \"2\"   : \"2\")\n           5 transitions (to turn off number \"2\").\n   For a grand total of 30 transitions.\n   Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.\n   The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10^7 and B =\n   2×10^7.\n   Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by\n   Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.\n   p_315_clocks.gif"

    description: "   We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers\n   {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has a\n   cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:\n     •\_\"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or\n     •\_\"Yes, that's it!\", or\n     •\_\"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".\n   Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e.\n   the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.\n   If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \"2\". The answer\n   will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).\n   If n=8, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our\n   first question would be \"4\" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we\n   will need one or two additional questions.\n   Let our second question be \"6\". If the hidden number is still higher than\n   6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.\n   Thus, our third question will be \"7\" and the total cost for this\n   worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.\n   We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking \"5\" as\n   our first question.\n   If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second\n   question will be \"7\", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number\n   is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).\n   If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question\n   will be \"3\" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question\n   will be \"1\", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.\n   Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better\n   than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is\n   also better than or equal to any other strategy.\n   So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.\n   Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as\n   described above.\n   Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.\n   Similarly, C(100) = 400 and C(n) = 17575.\n   Find C(n).\n   p_328_sum1.gif\n   p_328_sum2.gif"

For each\n   group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed.\n   Then,\n     •\_If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to\n       be virus-free.\n     •\_If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a\n       separate test for each animal) to determine the affected\n       individual(s).\n   Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02,\n   the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\n     •\_Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98^5 =\n       0.9039207968.\n     •\_Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968\n       = 0.0960792032.\n   Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5\n   = 1.480396016.\n   Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only\n   1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more\n   than 70% !\n   Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it\n   can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is\n   sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by\n   mixing different samples). E.g.:\n     •\_We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It\n       can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be\n       negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only\n       be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.\n     •\_If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and\n       the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to\n       run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).\n     •\_We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals\n       in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total\n       expected number of tests will be minimised.\n   To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction\n   we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we\n   start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must\n   be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached\n   for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\n   For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing\n   scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just\n   4.155452 tests!\n   Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of\n   tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p\n   to be present in any individual.\n   Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25,\n   0.10) = 12.702124.\n   Find ΣT(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.\n   Give your answer rounded to six decimal places."

Quentin, the representative from\n   the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture\n   cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base.\n   Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\n   Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered\n   from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the\n   horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of\n   repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the\n   silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the\n   case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted\n   would be approximately 32.648388556 m^3.

Fred points out to Quentin that it's the\n   radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of\n   repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of\n   solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep\n   it.\n   If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the\n   farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$\n   for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$\n   correct to 9 decimal places.\n   p_431_grain_silo.png"

From P[2](3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant\n   travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required\n   time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.\n   Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.\n   The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as\n   0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052.
